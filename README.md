Welcome to my portfolio — where pixels meet passion and `console.log("Where did it break this time?")` is a lifestyle choice.

## 🎮 What's This All About?

This is my personal portfolio site, built with Next.js 16, Tailwind CSS, and an unhealthy amount of caffeine. It showcases my projects, skills, and the existential journey of a Full Stack Developer navigating the infinite npm packages of the JavaScript ecosystem.

**Spoiler alert:** I do play valorant. Just... not during deployment cycles.

## ⚡ Tech Stack (a.k.a. My Infinity Stones)

- **Next.js 16** - Because React alone wasn't complicated enough
- **TypeScript** - For when you want JavaScript to yell at you *before* runtime
- **Tailwind CSS** - 47 utility classes per div, as the prophecy foretold
- **Radix/Shadcn UI** - Accessible components that don't make screen readers cry
- **Vercel** - Where my code goes to live its best deployed life

## 🏃‍♂️ Running This Bad Boy Locally

```bash
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone https://github.com/FazlulKarimC/portfolio.git

# Enter the matrix
cd faz_portfolio

# Summon the node_modules (grab a coffee ☕)
npm install

# Fire it up! 🔥
npm run dev
```

Now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and witness the magic ✨
